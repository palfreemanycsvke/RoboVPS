## Scraping Walmart Reviews and Ratings

### Python Example: Extracting Reviews

Hereâ€™s how to scrape Walmart reviews using Python:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36'
}

def scrape_reviews(product_url):
    response = requests.get(product_url, headers=headers)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

    reviews = []
    for review in soup.select('.review-text'):
        reviews.append(review.text.strip())

    return reviews

product_url = "https://www.walmart.com/ip/product-id"
reviews = scrape_reviews(product_url)
print(reviews)
```

### JavaScript Example: Extracting Reviews

```javascript
const cheerio = require('cheerio');
const fs = require('fs');

const htmlContent = fs.readFileSync('walmart-product-page.html', 'utf-8');
const $ = cheerio.load(htmlContent);

const reviews = [];
$('.review-section .review-text').each((index, element) => {
    reviews.push($(element).text().trim());
});

fs.writeFileSync('reviews.json', JSON.stringify(reviews, null, 2));
console.log('Reviews saved to reviews.json');
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Once youâ€™ve scraped the reviews, itâ€™s time to analyze the data for actionable insights.

### Key Analysis Techniques

1. **Visualizing Distributions:** Use histograms and box plots to understand the spread of ratings.
2. **Sentiment Analysis:** Classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral using natural language processing (NLP).
3. **Feature Extraction:** Identify the most frequently mentioned product features (e.g., "battery life").
4. **Trend Analysis:** Spot recurring themes or customer feedback trends.

### Example: Sentiment Analysis with Python

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

def analyze_sentiment(reviews):
    sentiments = []
    for review in reviews:
        blob = TextBlob(review)
        sentiments.append(blob.sentiment.polarity)
    return sentiments

sentiments = analyze_sentiment(reviews)
print("Average Sentiment Score:", sum(sentiments)/len(sentiments))
```
