## ScraperAPI Integration for Walmart Scraping

This Walmart scraper uses [ScraperAPI](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi) to manage proxies and bypass CAPTCHAs. ScraperAPI supports scaling from a few hundred requests during development to millions of requests for production.

### Setting Up ScraperAPI

1. **Install ScraperAPI Middleware:**

   ```bash
   pip install scrapeops-scrapy-proxy-sdk
   ```

2. **Update `settings.py`:**

   ```python
   SCRAPEOPS_API_KEY = 'SCRAPE9837861'

   SCRAPEOPS_PROXY_ENABLED = True

   DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
       'scrapeops_scrapy_proxy_sdk.scrapeops_scrapy_proxy_sdk.ScrapeOpsScrapyProxySdk': 725,
   }
   ```

3. **Monitor Performance:**  
   ScraperAPI provides seamless monitoring for your scraping tasks, helping optimize crawl speed and efficiency.

## Running the Walmart Scraper

Make sure Scrapy and the necessary dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install scrapy scrapeops-scrapy
```

To execute the spider, follow these steps:

1. Set search parameters in the `keyword_list` in the spider script.
2. Run the spider using:

   ```bash
   scrapy crawl walmart
   ```

## Customizing Your Walmart Scraper

### Modify Search Parameters
Update the `keyword_list` and sorting algorithms (`best_seller`, `price_low`, etc.) in the spider script to refine your search.

### Extract More Data
Customize the data extraction process by modifying the `yield` statements in the spider script. For example:

```python
yield {
    'id': raw_product_data.get('id'),
    'name': raw_product_data.get('name'),
    'brand': raw_product_data.get('brand'),
    'price': raw_product_data['priceInfo']['currentPrice'].get('price'),
    'currency': raw_product_data['priceInfo']['currentPrice'].get('currencyUnit'),
}
```

### Speed Up Crawling
Upgrade to a paid ScraperAPI plan to increase concurrency. Update `CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` in `settings.py` to speed up the scraping:

```python
CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 10
```

---

## Saving Scraped Data

The spider uses Scrapy's Feed Exports to store data in CSV format. You can modify the `custom_settings` parameter to save data in different formats:

```python
custom_settings = {
    'FEEDS': { 'data/%(name)s_%(time)s.csv': { 'format': 'csv' }}
}
```

### Alternative Storage Options

## Deactivating ScraperAPI

If you want to temporarily disable ScraperAPI, comment out the related settings in your `settings.py` file:

```python
# SCRAPEOPS_PROXY_ENABLED = True
# EXTENSIONS = {
#     'scrapeops_scrapy.extension.ScrapeOpsMonitor': 500,
# }
```
