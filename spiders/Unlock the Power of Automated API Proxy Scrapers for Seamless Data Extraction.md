## What is an API Proxy Scraper?

An API proxy scraper, as the name suggests, uses an API to fetch proxy IP addresses. Think of it as a magic wand â€” with the right key (your API key), you can unlock a list of proxy IPs. These IPs act as a cloak of invisibility for your scraper, effectively hiding its real identity and reducing the risk of getting banned.

By calling the proxy providerâ€™s API, you can easily access a pool of proxy IPs, filter them based on your needs, and use them to scrape data seamlessly. Whether youâ€™re looking for fast access to websites or stable connections, API proxy scrapers are designed to meet your requirements.
