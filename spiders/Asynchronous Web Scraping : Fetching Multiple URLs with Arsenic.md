# Asynchronous Web Scraping : Fetching Multiple URLs with Arsenic

Scraping websites effectively requires choosing the right tools and techniques. In this article, we explore two approaches to web scraping: synchronous and asynchronous. Using Universal Studios reviews on TripAdvisor as an example, we compare the efficiency and execution time of each method.

## Target Website: TripAdvisor Reviews

TripAdvisor is a platform for booking flights, accommodations, and experiences, as well as reviewing hotels, restaurants, and tours. For this demonstration, we aim to scrape reviews of Universal Studios from three branches (Florida, Singapore, Japan). Each branch has over 10,000 pages of reviews. We will extract the following data:
- Reviewer name
- Review date
- Review title
- Review text

With such a large dataset, using an efficient scraping method is essential.

## Synchronous Web Scraping with Selenium

### The Challenges of Scraping TripAdvisor
One of the key challenges with scraping TripAdvisor is the **"Read More" button**, which only loads the full review after clicking. This requires executing JavaScript to expand the content, making tools like BeautifulSoup insufficient. Instead, we use Selenium to simulate user interactions.

### Code Implementation
Selenium, paired with Chromedriver, is used to:
1. Open the webpage.
2. Click the "Read More" button to load full reviews.
3. Extract review details and save them into a CSV file.

However, this synchronous approach has a major drawback: **speed**. Scraping one page takes approximately 10 seconds. Scraping 30,000 pages would take an impractical amount of time.

## Asynchronous Web Scraping with Arsenic

Asynchronous programming significantly improves scraping efficiency by handling multiple URLs concurrently. Hereâ€™s how it works:

### The Benefits of Asynchronous Scraping
- **Time Efficiency**: Multiple URLs are processed simultaneously, reducing total execution time.
- **Simplified Workflow**: No need to handle "Read More" buttons manually, as complete information can be retrieved in a single session.

### Implementation Using Asyncio and Chromedriver
The asynchronous method involves:
1. **Dividing URLs into Batches**: URLs are processed in parallel using asyncio's event loop.
2. **Opening the Browser Asynchronously**: Chromedriver is used to open multiple browser sessions simultaneously.
3. **Extracting Data**: Elements like reviewer name, review date, title, and review text are retrieved directly without additional user interaction.

### Performance Comparison
- **Synchronous Scraping**: ~10 seconds per page.
- **Asynchronous Scraping**: ~1 second per page.
This makes asynchronous scraping nearly **10x faster** for large datasets.
